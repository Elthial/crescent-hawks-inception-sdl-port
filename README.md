<p align="center"><em>A readable C17 reconstruction of the 1988 DOS game.</em></p>

This repository is a C17 reconstruction of the 1988 DOS game. Its purpose is
preservation: represent the executable's procedures, data, control flow and
BattleTech rules as readable C while retaining a direct route back to the
assembly evidence.

This repository starts at the consolidated v1.0 preservation snapshot. The
monorepo's development commit history is intentionally not imported.

This is not a redesign. DOS, BIOS and hardware operations are redirected at
the lowest practical boundary to SDL3 and portable host services; game logic
remains in the reconstructed procedure chain.

## Current status

Version 1.0 is supported and tested only on 64-bit Windows. The code is intended
to remain portable, but other host platforms are not release-qualified.

- The reconstructed source is divided between original logic in
  `src/Original` and platform replacements in `src/SDL`.
- The real entry point reaches the original `Setup_Game` procedure; production
  builds do not substitute a test bootstrap or replacement game loop.
- The clean v1.0 Release runs pass 117 asset-independent headless tests and 148
  SDL tests without private game data. Supplying a legal original installation
  enables 15 additional local asset-integration tests (163 total).
- Original title, map, exploration, menus, services, training, combat,
  save/load and shutdown paths have connected coverage.
- A complete manual playthrough and exact presentation/audio fidelity remain
  uncertified. See [`docs/RUNTIME_STATUS.md`](docs/RUNTIME_STATUS.md).

## Quick start

Requirements are Windows, PowerShell, Visual Studio C/C++ build tools and a
legally obtained original game installation. CMake/Ninja are taken from Visual
Studio; SDL3 is fetched at its pinned checksum unless supplied explicitly.

Run the asset-independent Release build and tests:

```powershell
./Build.ps1 -Headless -Configuration Release
```

For local play, put the original data files in `assets/original-game` and run:

```powershell
./Run-Inception.ps1
```

Or use an installation elsewhere:

```powershell
./Run-Inception.ps1 -OriginalAssetDirectory ../Chinception
```

The direct launcher allows the game to update saves in the selected directory.
Use `-Isolated` to play from a private copy under the ignored build directory.
The old `Run.ps1` name remains as a compatibility wrapper.

## Minimal runtime package

Create a distributable runtime shell with:

```powershell
./Build.ps1 -Configuration Release -Package
```

`build-release/package` contains exactly:

```text
CrescentHawksInception.exe
CrescentHawksInception.ini
```

SDL3 is linked statically. The package contains no copyrighted game data.
`build-release/CrescentHawksInception-1.0.0-SHA256SUMS.txt` records the SHA-256
of both package files and is intentionally kept beside the package directory.
With `asset_directory=.`, both files may be copied into an original game
installation. A relative or absolute path may instead keep program and data
separate. `CHI_ASSET_DIRECTORY` overrides the file for launchers and tests.

## Repository map

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `src/Original` | Readable reconstruction of executable procedures and data |
| `src/SDL` | SDL3 and host implementations below DOS/hardware boundaries |
| `src/Original/*.h`, `src/SDL/*.h` | Interfaces owned by their respective source domains |
| `tests` | Behavioral, integration and preservation checks |
| `evidence` | Self-contained annotations, assembly, metadata and research |
| `docs` | Current policy, runtime status and focused conversion records |
| `tools` | Repository and package validation scripts |
| `assets/original-game` | Ignored placeholder for user-supplied original data |

The governing rules are in
[`docs/PRESERVATION_PLAN.md`](docs/PRESERVATION_PLAN.md), and directory
ownership is described in [`docs/SOURCE_LAYOUT.md`](docs/SOURCE_LAYOUT.md).
The supported DOS executable hashes are recorded in
[`docs/SUPPORTED_VERSIONS.md`](docs/SUPPORTED_VERSIONS.md).

Contributions must follow [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md), particularly the
original-bug and SDL-boundary rules. Release changes are in
[`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).
